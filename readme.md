### Extracting actors in-scene presence timestamps using CNN embeddings workshop

This repository contains the project for participants of [**AI Summer Weekend**](https://www.facebook.com/events/1841279602835641/) summer weekend. The goal to create an intuition how to drive AI projects
and give practical experience of creating computer vision system using open libraries and existing state of the art approaches


#### Prerequisites

In the file requirements.txt, there is a list of python packages needed to run this project

It is recommended to use [anaconda](http://anaconda.org/) to create environment for this project, because then you can just downloaded prebuilt packages ([opencv](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv), [dlib](https://anaconda.org/menpo/dlib))
#### Dataset

I prepared subset of [IMDB-WIKI](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) dataset for this task. 
* [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iyN4HAHe5GQ8GCwuvIV-WFOpoKE-2M8k/view?usp=sharing) - actor faces dataset
