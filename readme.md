### Extracting actors in-scene presence timestamps using CNN embeddings workshop

This repository contains the project for participants of [**AI Summer Weekend**](https://www.facebook.com/events/1841279602835641/). 
The goal to create an intuition on how to drive AI projects and give practical experience in creating computer vision system using open libraries and existing state of the art approaches


#### Prerequisites

In the file requirements.txt, there is a list of python packages needed to run this project

It is recommended to use [anaconda](http://anaconda.org/) to create environment for this project, because then you can just downloaded prebuilt packages ([opencv](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv), [dlib](https://anaconda.org/menpo/dlib))
#### Dataset

I prepared subset of [IMDB-WIKI](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) dataset for this task. It has already precomputed embeddings using spherenet
* [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LvigpAC6wrUEA-iDzBgiT6O5qn4Q86K8/view?usp=sharing) - actor faces dataset

#### Model

Pretrained model weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yj5cFMSInc_jA7PSoUxmgN5bb4w6ul6C/view?usp=sharing)


#### Testing video

Small [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vWB4znh6r7DDmQho94SbViiL1SeKTwgb/view?usp=sharing) to test a system
